# Plant Anywhere
This mod allows you to plant and grow things anywhere independent of the biome.
Primarily made this mod to have flax and barley in my settlement and don't have to go to the plains all the time.

You can also optional normalize the growth time so that all plants of one type grow at the same rate.
